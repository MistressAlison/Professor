# The Professor

This mod currently adds a new playable character, The Professor.

Alongside them is a new set of 87 cards, 5 Relics, and 2 Potions. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

Character, relic, and other assets are from Disgaea and are property of Nippon Ichi Software.

Features
---
The Professor is an alchemist loosely based around the Atelier series; gameplay will involve breaking down cards, creating new cards, and adding extra effects to existing cards. The Professor's main mechanics are Elements, Synthesis, Infuse, Spectrumize, and Unstable.

_**Elements:**_
 Elements are a passive classification that cards will have while Professor is installed. Cards will automatically be given some combination of Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Wind based on the effects the card has. Elements do nothing on their own but other cards and mechanics will interact with them.

_**Synthesis:**_
Use Blueprint cards to create a new card that is strengthened based on the Elements on the cards you choose to contribute. This process takes a turn to perform, giving you the finished product at the start of your next turn and discarding the cards you contributed to it previously.

_**Infuse:**_
Add extra effects into your cards to change how they work. Turn Skills into Attacks by adding damaging effects, and scale through combat by Infusing multiple effects into cheap cards.

_**Spectrumize:**_
Break a card down into Neutralizer tokens based on what Elements the card has. Neutralizers all have a single effect related to their Element, Exhaust, and have special synergy when used in Synthesis.

_**Unstable:**_
Corrupt an enemy and make it take additional damage from Attacks. Offers an additional scaling solution if you outpace its slow decay, and has a unique visual effect.
